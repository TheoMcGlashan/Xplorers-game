Core game ideas:

You start in a space ship at a home base in the center of four regions of space.
Mechanically, the four regions are four paths that you can go down. The paths are nonlinear, similar to slay the spire.
In universe, you are traveling further into the regions as you draw through the deck.
There is potentially a total turn limit, after which you must fight evil overlord mushroom man.



Need to balance going back to the ship to resupply and heal:
 In universe, if you discover natural resources, you can use that to convince the company that sent you here to spend more resources on your expedition.
 Mechanically, every time you draw a card from one of the region decks, there will be a reward after you beat the card encounter.
